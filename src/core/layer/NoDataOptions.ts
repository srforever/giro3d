     * Enables no-data replacement. The algorithm is similar to the
     * [GDALFillNodata()](https://gdal.org/api/gdal_alg.html#_CPPv414GDALFillNodata15GDALRasterBandH15GDALRasterBandHdiiPPc16GDALProgressFuncPv)
     * function in the GDAL library. The main difference is that the distance is in CRS units rather
     * than pixels.
     *
     * This algorithm replaces any no-data pixel by the nearest valid pixel color, within
     * {@link maxSearchDistance}. The alpha value of the replaced pixel is specified by
     * {@link alpha}. No-data pixels that are outside the distance are replaced by transparent
     * black.
     *
     * The main use cases are:
     * - Hole filling: any hole that is smaller than {@link maxSearchDistance} will be filled
     * with values at the edge of the hole. In this case {@link alpha} should be `1`. Typically
     * used for color and mask layers to remove small holes and other similar artifacts, or to
     * smooth irregular edges.
     * - Geometry smoothing. For elevation layers that contain no-data pixels, the geometry of the
     * map will show steep walls at the boundary between valid and no-data pixels. In this case, we
     * want to replace no-data pixels with nearest pixels while still making them transparent.
     * Typically used for elevation layers. In this case, {@link alpha} should be `0`, and
     * {@link maxSearchDistance} should be set to either a big value (far enough from the dataset's
     * edges), or `+Infinity`.

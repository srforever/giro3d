title: Query map elevations
shortdesc: Sample elevation at various points in the map.
longdesc: Use the <a target="_blank" href="../apidoc/classes/entities.Map.html#getElevation"><code>getElevation()</code></a> method to sample the elevation at a given coordinate. Each label is dynamically updated with the most precise elevation available at this location. Note that <code>getElevation()</code> only works for regions of the map that are loaded. In this example, we use the elevation data from the map to move the summit labels at the correct altitude.

<!--
    In all examples we are using Bootstrap classes for styling.
    Here, we are using:
    - plain-old styles to show how to use different layouts,
    - Bootstrap classes and embedded <style> for pure styling (borders, padding, margin, backgrounds, etc.).
-->

<div id="legendSticky" style="position: sticky; z-index: 1021; top: 0" class="ps-2">
    Sticky position
</div>
<!-- A container must have a size (height+width), and can have any style applied-->
<div
    id="viewerDivSticky"
    style="position: sticky; z-index: 1020; top: 0; height: 300px; width: 100%"
    class="viewer p-2 border-bottom border-5 border-dark"
></div>

<div id="containerFlex" style="display: flex; align-items: stretch; height: 50vh" class="mt-5">
    <div id="legendNestedFlex" class="pt-2">Nested flex layouts</div>
    <!-- In flex display, a container can have a flex property instead of a size -->
    <div id="viewerDivNestedFlex1" style="flex: 1 1 auto" class="viewer ps-2 pe-2"></div>

    <!--
        In case you are using your own renderer, you are responsible for the layout, for instance:
        - a parent div to set the element size - this is were you would want to apply borders, padding, backgrounds, etc.
        - a viewport div that fills it parent and has "position: relative" and "overflow: hidden"
            - this is to ensure a correct sizing of the renderer when the parent div is resized
        - the div that will hold your renderer, that fills its parent
    -->
    <div style="min-width: 20vw; height: 100%" class="p-5 border border-3 border-dark">
        <div
            id="customViewDivContainer"

<!-- You can also have containers that are larger than the viewport -->
<div id="viewerDivOverflow" style="width: 100%; height: 200vh" class="viewer p-2"></div>

<!-- You can also have containers that are at fixed positions -->

<span id="legendFixed" style="position: fixed; left: 0; bottom: 0" class="ps-2">
    Fixed position

# TODO find a way to use stages with 2 parallel pipelines
#
# rationale: I'd like to have a 3 stages pipelines: install, test and deploy, and execute it for
# each supported node version.
#
# I cannot really do that now because gitlab does not seem to support having 2 distinct pipelines.
# the only thing you can do is:
#
#          stage install               stage test              stage deploy
# *---- npm i with node 8----*----npm test with node 8----*---...
#  \___ npm i with node 10__/ \___npm test with node 10___/
#
# this is problematic because I really don't want the node_modules/ folder to be mixed between
# versions.
#
# Instead, we'd like to have:
#
# *---- npm i with node 8----*----npm test with node 8----*---...
# *---- npm i with node 10---*----npm test with node 10___*---...
